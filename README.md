# To-Do-List

To Do List done in TypeScript.
Tasks are divided into two sections: planned tasks and done tasks.
App enables the possibility to mark task as done, return the task to planned tasks (after marking as done already), edit tasks and remove tasks from both sections.
App also shows planned date for task completion and actual date of completion (after marking the task as done).
App stores tasks in Local Storage.
